# Band-Setlist-ASP.NET-Web-API-Backend-
Developed with ASP.NET, an app made for bands to create an organized setlist. 
The Band Setlist application allows users to create a setlist to prepare for a band gig. The application uses CRUD methods allowing the user to add, edit, and delete their songs from the setlist. The backend of the application was created using C# and the ASP.NET framework.
